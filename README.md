# eCommerce Frontend Challenge by Jaden Park

## Deployed At

## Github 

* https://github.com/LeetDit/eCommerce

## API

* https://openweathermap.org/api

## Dependencies

* Axios

## Time Spent

* 6 hours

## Difficulties

1. Finding the free weather API which provides future forecasts
2. Finding the similar font used in the mockup
3. Responsiveness of content

## Limitation

1. The icon was used directly from the API supplier, therefore the color may seem little bland which causes lack of contrast alongside the background color.
2. Seldom delay in API calls which causes slight delay in updating to new city data when selected.

## To run locally

1. git clone repository
2. npm install
3. npm start
4. Note. credential such as API_Key has been .gitignored, therefore user needs to obtain their own API_KEY


# eCommerce - Frontend Challenge

Create a simple app to display the weather in three cities.

* Implement a fully functional React app from the mockup. Approximate spacing, responsiveness, colors etc. as closely as possible.

* Use the API of any free weather service to show weather in real time for three cities of your choosing. 
(yahoo, openweathermap, theweathernetwork, etc).

* All weather should be represented by an icon or graphic as shown in the mockup. 
You may choose to use any icon pack you like, such as Fontawesome.

* Deploy to a server that can be accessed over the internet. 
You can use any host of your choosing such as Netlify, Vercel, GatsbyCloud, AWS, Heroku. Be sure to include the url in your submission.

## Requirements

* The app is built with React
* The app is fully functional and all weather is retrieved in real time
* The app is properly deployed to a hosting service
* All UI elements responds appropriately to user actions
* Code is hosted in a public repository, like Github.com

* Bonus: Use of typescript
* Bonus: Use of LESS in part or completely
* Bonus: Use of React class components instead of functional componenets

## What we're looking for

1. Accurate implementation of mockup
2. High quality and polished code
3. Use of modern tooling, libraries and ES6+ functions
